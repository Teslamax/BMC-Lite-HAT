# BMC-Lite HAT ‚Äì Power Architecture & Safety

This document describes how power flows through the BMC-Lite HAT system and explains the use of diodes to safely support both Raspberry Pi and USB power sources.

---

## üîã Overview

The system is designed to allow the Raspberry Pi and USB-C to be connected at the same time without risk of damaging backfeed.

### Power Sources:
- **USB-C** ‚Üí XIAO RP2040 (internal Schottky protection)
- **Raspberry Pi 5V GPIO (Pin 2 or 4)** ‚Üí external Schottky diode ‚Üí XIAO VIN

Both sources feed into a common `V_SYS` rail safely.

## üîå Diode-Based Protection

### XIAO RP2040 (Built-in):
- Includes a **Schottky diode** from USB-C to VBUS (Pin 14)
- Prevents backfeed from Pi into USB host

### Raspberry Pi to XIAO (External):
- A **1N5819** or similar diode is placed between the Pi‚Äôs 5V rail and the XIAO‚Äôs VBUS
- Prevents USB power from backfeeding into the Pi

## ‚úÖ Safe Use Cases

| Power Scenario             | Safe? | Notes                                        |
|----------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| Only Pi connected (no USB) | ‚úÖ    | Pi powers XIAO through D1                    |
| Only USB connected         | ‚úÖ    | USB powers XIAO via internal diode           |
| Both connected             | ‚úÖ    | Each input is isolated; no current conflict  |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Use **low forward-voltage Schottky diodes** for efficient power transfer
- Place a **47‚Äì100‚ÄØ¬µF capacitor** near VIN and GND to smooth transitions
- No need for a physical switch ‚Äî diode logic handles source selection

## üß™ Development Notes

- If powering from USB only, the Pi can be safely unplugged or powered off
- For final deployment, USB can be used for data/firmware only, not power
