# BMC-Lite HAT Project Overview

A compact, GPIO-enhancing companion board designed for headless Raspberry Pi systems, especially the Pi Zero form factor. The board is based around the **Seeed XIAO RP2040** and provides button input handling, system state indication, safe power interaction, and debugging capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Built-in XIAO RP2040 microcontroller (preassembled)
- Shutdown, reboot, and user-configurable buttons
- RGB status LED (uses onboard XIAO RGB LED)
- UART communication with Pi (for Pi serial console parsing or USB CDC passthrough)
- Optional OLED display via I¬≤C header
- Pi GPIO signal input/output (heartbeat, poweroff-ready, etc.)
- Debounced button handling (software or via optional I¬≤C GPIO expander)
- Power protection using Schottky diodes to prevent backfeed between Pi and USB
- **Development/Deployment switch** for safe power source management

## üß† Development vs Deployment Mode

To safely support debugging over USB while also allowing Pi-powered deployment, a **physical SPDT switch** (or jumper header) is used to select between power sources:

### üõ† DEV Mode (Debugging)
- XIAO RP2040 is powered via USB-C from your Mac/PC
- Pi also connected to your Mac for serial/SSH/power (Pi Zero 2)
- **Switch disables Pi 5V connection to XIAO**, preventing USB port backfeed

### üöÄ RUN Mode (Deployment)
- Pi powers the XIAO via GPIO Pin 2 through a **Schottky diode**
- USB-C is unplugged or only connected for data (not power)
- XIAO receives power only from the Pi

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
- Never connect both USB-C and Pi 5V with the switch in the wrong position.
- A properly labeled switch position (e.g., "`DEV` ‚Üê‚Üí `RUN`") is strongly recommended.

---

## üîã Power Architecture

- **V_SYS rail** is shared between Pi 5V (via diode) and optional USB power
- XIAO VBUS (Pin 14) is connected to V_SYS in `RUN` mode (switch `SW1_XIAO-POWER-ISOLATION` is closed)
- Schottky diode (e.g., SS14 or BAT54) protects the Pi from reverse current when USB is connected

---

## üß± Physical Configuration

- Board form factor: pHAT or smaller if possible, compatible with Pi Zero GPIO headers
- GPIO header footprint supports stacking headers or through-holes only
- OLED I¬≤C header (4-pin, with labeled address: `0x3C`)
- I¬≤C GPIO expander (MCP23008 or MCP23017 footprint,, with labeled address: `0x20`)

---

## üì° Heartbeat Signal Configuration

To indicate that the Pi is alive and Linux is running, a pulsed heartbeat signal is sent to the XIAO:

### ü´Ä Enable Heartbeat via `config.txt`

Add this to `/boot/config.txt` on the Pi:

```ini
dtoverlay=gpio-led,gpio=6,trigger=heartbeat
```

- This configures **RPI GPIO6 (Pin 31)** to pulse at ~1Hz automatically
- Signal starts early in boot and requires no additional software
- Connect **RPI GPIO6** to **I2C Expander-MCP23008 GPIO7 (Pin 19)** to monitor
