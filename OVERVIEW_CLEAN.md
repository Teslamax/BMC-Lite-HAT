# BMC-Lite HAT ‚Äì System Overview

BMC-Lite HAT is a compact Raspberry Pi companion board designed to provide basic BMC-like functionality such as controlled shutdown, reboot, user input, and visual feedback for headless systems.

Built around the Seeed XIAO RP2040, it integrates clean power handling, GPIO signaling, and serial monitoring in a Pi Zero-sized footprint.

## ‚úÖ Key Capabilities

- Clean shutdown, reboot, and user interaction via physical buttons
- Visual feedback through onboard RGB LED (NeoPixel)
- Safe power sharing between Pi and USB using Schottky diodes
- DEV vs RUN mode switch for debugging vs deployment
- UART-based serial monitoring
- Optional I¬≤C OLED and GPIO expander (MCP23017)
## üß† Development vs Deployment Mode

To safely support USB debugging and Pi-powered deployment, a physical SPDT switch is used to isolate power sources:

### üõ† DEV Mode (Debugging)
- XIAO RP2040 powered by USB-C
- Pi powered separately (e.g., from your Mac)
- **Pi 5V disconnected from XIAO** to prevent backfeed

### üöÄ RUN Mode (Deployment)
- XIAO powered by Pi via GPIO Pin 2 (with Schottky diode)
- USB-C unplugged or connected for data only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Note
- Do not connect both USB-C and Pi 5V with the switch in the wrong position.
- Label switch positions clearly (`DEV` ‚Üê‚Üí `RUN`).
## üîã Power Architecture

- `V_SYS` rail is shared between Pi 5V (via diode) and USB-C
- XIAO VBUS (Pin 14) connects to V_SYS in RUN mode
- Schottky diodes prevent reverse current into Pi or USB host
## ü´Ä Heartbeat Monitoring

To indicate the Pi is alive:

Add to `/boot/config.txt`:
```ini
dtoverlay=gpio-led,gpio=6,trigger=heartbeat
```

- Uses **GPIO6 (Pin 31)** to pulse at ~1Hz
- Connect to **XIAO GPIO10** or MCP23017 GPIO for monitoring
## üì¶ Physical & Logical Summary

- Board form factor: pHAT (fits Pi Zero footprint)
- GPIO header: stacking or through-hole
- Optional 4-pin OLED header (`0x3C`)
- Optional MCP23017 I/O expander (`0x20`)
